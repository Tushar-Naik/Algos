	 * (b) Use elements popped from stack (reverse post order) and do DFS all DFS graphs are Strongly connected
	 * 
	 * NOTE
	 * ->Assuming all Strongly connected components are one node then graph we get is DAG ( removed cycle)
	 * ->Strongly components in G is same as reverse of Graph G (G^R). Since we need edges in both directions
